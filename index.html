                    enabling intelligent summaries, content generation, and enhanced on-screen actions. Itâ€™s designed
                    to understand personal context, making interactions more relevant.</li>
                <li><strong>Revamped Siri:</strong> Siri receives a significant overhaul, becoming more natural,
                    conversational, and context-aware. With Apple Intelligence, Siri can now perform more complex
                    tasks across apps, understand on-screen information, and even execute multi-step requests with
                    greater accuracy. A new visual redesign makes interactions more fluid.</li>
                <li><strong>Writing Tools:</strong> System-wide writing tools leverage AI to help users rewrite,
                    proofread, and summarize text across various applications, from Mail to Notes and third-party apps.
                    This promises to boost productivity and refine communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Image Playground & Genmoji:</strong> Unleashing creative potential, Image Playground allows
                    users to generate playful images based on descriptions within apps like Messages. Genmoji takes
                    emoji creation to the next level, letting users create custom emojis for any moment, providing
                    a truly personalized expression.</li>
                <li><strong>ChatGPT Integration:</strong> Apple announced a partnership with OpenAI, integrating
                    ChatGPT directly into Apple Intelligence experiences. Users will have the option to send
                    information to ChatGPT for advanced content generation, with strict privacy controls requiring
                    user permission for data sharing.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>From the Keynote:</strong> "Apple Intelligence is a deeply personal and private intelligence
                system that fundamentally changes what you can do with your devices. It's intelligence that works
                for you, respecting your privacy every step of the way."

            <h2>Liquid Glass: A Stunning New Design Language</h2>
            <p>
                Apple introduced **Liquid Glass**, an entirely new software design language that will be
                implemented across iOS, iPadOS, macOS, watchOS, and visionOS. This refresh focuses on translucency,
                fluidity, and vibrant visual effects, creating an interface that feels dynamic and alive while keeping
                the user's content front and center.
            </p>
            <h3>Design Principles and Impact:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Translucency and Depth:</strong> Elements now feature subtle transparency, allowing
                    background content to subtly show through, adding depth and a modern aesthetic.</li>
                <li><strong>Dynamic Visuals:</strong> Animations and transitions are more fluid and expressive,

                <li><strong>Refined Typography and Iconography:</strong> Updates to system fonts and app icons complement
                    the Liquid Glass aesthetic, offering a cleaner, more cohesive look across the entire ecosystem.</li>
                <li><strong>Systemwide Consistency:</strong> This new design language aims to bring a greater sense
                    of visual unity across all Apple platforms, making the experience more seamless whether you're
                    on your iPhone, iPad, or Mac.</li>
            </ul>
            <div class="highlight-box">
                <strong>From the Keynote:</strong> "Liquid Glass isn't just a new look; it's a new feeling. It's about
                making your content the star, with an interface that's dynamic, delightful, and always in flow."

                year-based naming system), brings significant enhancements focused on personalization, communication,
                and deeper AI integration.
            </p>
            <h3>Key iOS 26 Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Redesigned Home Screen & Lock Screen:</strong> Users now have unprecedented control over
                    their Home Screen layout, with the ability to place apps and widgets anywhere, leaving gaps to showcase
                    wallpapers. The Lock Screen also gets more customization options for buttons and visual effects.</li>
                <li><strong>Overhauled Phone App:</strong> A major redesign for the Phone app introduces a new compact
                    call view that gets out of the way of other tasks. Call Screening, Hold Assist, and Live Translation
                    for calls enhance communication.</li>
                <li><strong>Messages Improvements:</strong> Live Translation for messages, improved Smart Replies,
                    contextual action suggestions (like Check In or Apple Cash), and personalized chat backgrounds
                    make conversations richer and more intelligent. Polls are also now integrated directly.</li>
                <li><strong>Photos App Redesign:</strong> The Photos app undergoes its "biggest redesign ever,"
                    offering a simplified single view that automatically organizes photo libraries into helpful
                    collections. New filtering options, including the ability to filter out screenshots, help declutter.</li>
                <li><strong>Spatial Scenes:</strong> Leveraging machine learning, any 2D photo can now be transformed
                    into a spatial scene, creating a simulated depth effect when you move the iPhone, offering a
                    delightful 3D-like experience.</li>
                <li><strong>New Dedicated Gaming App:</strong> A centralized Gaming app provides personalized discovery,
                    a Game Overlay for in-game settings, and social features, uniting third-party games with Apple Arcade.</li>
